## 1. BUILDER PITCH SCRIPT (Mumbai + Pune)

### Opening (30 seconds)
```
"Hi [Builder Name], I'm [Your Name] from BidMetric.

Quick question: How much are you spending per month to get
qualified buyer leads for your projects in [Locality]?

Most builders I talk to spend ₹2-5 lakh per month on portals
like 99acres and MagicBricks — and still get 60-70% junk leads.

What if I told you there's a way to get verified, biometric-checked
buyers who've already passed our AI qualification — and you only
pay for leads that actually show up for site visits?"
```

### Value Proposition (60 seconds)
```
"BidMetric is India's first builder-funded lead platform.
Here's how it works:

1. QUALIFIED LEADS (₹250 each)
   We verify every buyer with Aadhaar + OTP.
   Our AI scores each lead. You only see leads
   scored 8/20 or above. No junk. No dealers.

2. VERIFIED SITE VISITS (₹500 each)
   We book the cab. We do biometric check-in at your site.
   If the buyer doesn't show up — you don't pay.

3. ASSISTED CLOSING (1% commission)
   We handle negotiation, loan processing, documentation,
   and Sub-Registrar coordination.
   You just build. We close.

4. ANTI-LEAK PROTECTION
   Every buyer is hash-locked to you for 90 days.
   If they try to go direct, we detect it.
   Your leads stay YOUR leads."
```

### Objection Handling
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "₹250/lead is expensive" | "On 99acres you pay ₹500-2000 and get unverified leads. Our leads are Aadhaar-verified with intent scoring. Your effective cost per site visit is ₹750 total. Compare that to ₹5,000+ on other portals." |
| "We already have our own team" | "Perfect — this adds to your team's pipeline. Your sales team closes; we bring the prospects. Most builders see 15-20% incremental closings from Platform leads." |
| "What if buyers go around you?" | "Every buyer is hash-locked. Our system tracks all interactions. 90-day exclusivity. First violation = ₹50K penalty. Second = ₹2L. This is the strongest anti-circumvention in the market." |
| "1% closing commission is too much" | "You're paying 2-3% to channel partners already. We bring the buyer AND handle the closing paperwork. Net savings = 1-2% per deal." |
| "We don't need loan services" | "65% of your buyers need home loans. When we attach the loan, your booking doesn't fall through. It's insurance for your pipeline." |
| "Can we try it first?" | "Absolutely. First 5 leads are FREE. No commitment. If they convert, you're hooked. If not, you've lost nothing." |

### Closing (20 seconds)
```
"Here's what I suggest:

Let me sign you up today. It takes 5 minutes.
First 5 leads are on us — completely free.
You'll have your builder dashboard live by tonight.

All I need is:
✅ Company name
✅ RERA number
✅ Contact person
✅ One active project to list

Can we do that right now?"
